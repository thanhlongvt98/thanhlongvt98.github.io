I'm excited to share two interactive visualization tools I've developed for working with 5G communication systems:

## QAM LLR Visualizer

The [QAM LLR Visualizer](/files/20251203/qam_llr_visualizer.html) calculates and visualizes Log-Likelihood Ratios (LLR) for various QAM modulation schemes (QPSK, 16-QAM, 64-QAM, etc.), showing how LLR values vary with signal-to-noise ratio and other parameters.

## 5G LDPC Base Graphs Visualizer

The [5G LDPC Base Graphs Visualizer](/files/20251203/base_graphs_visualizer.html) provides an interactive exploration of LDPC base graphs (BG1 and BG2) used in 5G New Radio standards, allowing visualization of graph structures and parity check matrices.
